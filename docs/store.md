# Ticker! Timer

A simple timer for GameMasters that also displays from the player's view.

**General Information**

The time buttons are cumulative, so clicking them multiple times will allow for larger durations.

The timer is only operable from the GameMaster's end.  On the player's end, it'll just show an animated hourglass along with a text display of the time remaining.

If you have Ticker minimized, it'll have a yellow notification bubble to show you an update every 5 seconds with the remaining time, or if the timer has been paused. A red bubble will be displayed when time is up.
